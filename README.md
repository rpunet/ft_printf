# ft_printf

This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. You will then be allowed to reuse the function in your future projects. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments.

-  The prototype of ft_printf should be int ft_printf(const char *, ...);
-  You have to recode the libc’s printf function
-  It must not do the buffer management like the real printf
-  It will manage the following conversions: cspdiuxX%
-  It will manage any combination of the following flags: ’-0.*’ and minimum field
width with all conversions
-  It will be compared with the real printf
-  You must use the command ar to create your librairy, using the command libtool
is forbidden
